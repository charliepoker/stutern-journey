        Sometimes you just can’t beat fresh, simple, and classic Margherita
        Pizza. This margherita pizza recipe begins with my homemade pizza dough.
        Top with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes, then finish it off with
        garden-fresh basil. This is an easy pizza recipe with unbeatable flavor!

          We moved into our new house last week. After 12 hours on our feet
          moving boxes, we dashed to the nearest restaurant and found ourselves
          ordering appetizers and a five cheese + tomato pizza from a local
          joint. I usually prefer pizza with a ton of fixings like this spinach
          artichoke pizza,<strong>
            BBQ chicken pizza, or overloaded Hawaiian pizza,</strong
          >
          I’ve been craving pizza simplicity since noshing on those plain slices
          last week. Today’s classic margherita pizza recipe is like a regular
          cheese pizza, but all grown up.
          <u>Look at all this beautiful basil!</u>
        </p>

          The best homemade margherita pizza begins with homemade pizza dough.
          Homemade pizza dough may sound difficult to you.

            >Why waste the time when you can just buy frozen pizza
            dough?</strong
          >
          Well, here’s a fact: Homemade pizza dough has a delicious flavor and
          texture that only comes from YOU!

        <h2>Pizza Dough Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
          my recipe for homemade pizza dough. There’s only 6 ingredients, plus
          some water.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Yeast</strong>: Instant yeast makes the job quicker</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Water</strong>: Use warm water to reduce the rise time,
            about 105ºF – 115ºF. Anything over 130ºF is too hot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flour</strong>: It’s best to use unbleached all-purpose
            white flour in the pizza crust. Bleaching the flour strips away some
            of the protein, which reduces the amount of water the flour can
            absorb.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Oil</strong>: Extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor.
            Don’t forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the
            toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Salt & Sugar</strong>: Salt adds flavor and sugar increases
            the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cornmeal</strong>: Use cornmeal to dust the pizza pan; it
            gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The homemade pizza crust is soft and fluffy in the center with
          deliciously crisp edges. It’s an all around basic pizza crust recipe
          and has quickly become a reader favorite.
          <em>The best part is You can make the dough in advance</em>. See

        <h2>Margherita Pizza Toppings</h2>
        <p>
          Despite how I feel about loading up on pizza toppings, less is more
          when it comes to margherita pizza. Plain, simple, and easy, margherita
          pizza is fulfilling without too much grease weighing it down. There
          are only 4-5 ingredients on top of the <a href="#">Pizza dough.</a>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>For absolute best flavor, use homemade roasted garlic.</li>
          <li>Use your favorite homemade tomato sauce.</li>
          <li>Top with good quality mozzarella.</li>
          <li>And fresh juicy tomatoes, any size.</li>
          <li>
            Plus lots of fresh basil. And bonus if the basil is from your
            garden.
          </li>
          <li>
            Garlic, juicy tomatoes, and fresh basil also taste wonderful on top
            of homemade focaccia!
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Homemade Pizza Baking Equipment</h2>
        <p>There’s only 3 crucial tools you need for homemade pizza.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Stand Mixer</strong>: An electric stand mixer is preferred
            for making homemade pizza crust, but you don’t <em>NEED</em> it. You
            can simply mix and knead the dough by hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pizza Pan</strong>: Some pizza enthusiasts own pizza stones,
            baking stones, and pizza peels. If you have them– awesome. If you
            don’t, just use a regular pizza pan or a baking sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pizza Cutter</strong>: This OXO pizza cutter because it’s
            sharp, comfortable, and easy.
          </li>
        </ul>
